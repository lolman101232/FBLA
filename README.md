1. <!DOCTYPE html>

	•	This line declares the document type, letting the browser know that this is an HTML5 document. It’s essential for ensuring the page displays consistently across browsers.

2. <html lang="en">

	•	The <html> tag is the root element of the HTML document. The lang="en" attribute specifies that the language of the document is English. This helps search engines and browsers (especially screen readers) understand the primary language of the content.

3. <head> ... </head>

	•	The <head> section contains metadata about the HTML document, which is not directly visible on the page but provides information for browsers and search engines.
	•	<meta charset="UTF-8">: This line specifies the character encoding as UTF-8, which is a standard encoding that supports all characters and symbols in most languages. It ensures that characters are displayed correctly.
	•	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: This tag controls the viewport settings, especially on mobile devices. The width=device-width part makes the viewport match the device’s width, while initial-scale=1.0 sets the zoom level to 100%. This tag helps ensure the page is responsive and displays well on different screen sizes.
	•	<title>Document</title>: This sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser’s title bar or tab. Here, it’s set to “Document,” but it could be changed to any relevant title.

4. <body> ... </body>

	•	The <body> section contains the content that will be displayed on the web page. Here, the only content is the word “hi,” which will appear as plain text on the page.
